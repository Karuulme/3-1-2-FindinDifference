**Hello,**

Without checking index numbers.
Find the largest difference between the numbers in the array so that the index number of the larger number is greater than the index number of the smaller number.

I can give a short example of this

> 3-1-2

let's take a closer look, if we start the loop at index 0, it will give us the value 2.
if we start the loop in reverse.  gives us the value 1.
